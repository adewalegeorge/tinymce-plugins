# Simple TinyMCE Project

This is a basic example demonstrating how to integrate the TinyMCE rich text editor into a web page.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Prerequisites

- An internet connection to load the TinyMCE library from the CDN.
- (Optional) Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your own TinyMCE API key for more features and usage beyond the basic level. You can obtain a free API key from the [TinyMCE website](https://www.tiny.cloud/).

## Usage

The `index.html` file contains a textarea that is replaced by the TinyMCE editor. You can type and format text within the editor.
